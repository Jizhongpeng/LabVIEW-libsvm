## TODOs (not in any particular order)
1.  Redirect stdout and stderr, used in libsvm, to a file (using freopen("file.txt","w",stdout/stderr)) or user event.
2.  Make the print function user events per-instance
3.  Implement user-friendly precomputed kernels (in LabVIEW)
4a. Make an object-oriented interface in LabVIEW.
4b. Encapsulate the svm_problem / linear_problem in a DVR to avoid data duplication, might be necessary for huge datasets.
5.  Create an interface to libsvm-dense, which uses dense feature vectors to improve performance.
